## Motivation

**Philips Hue is awesome! Let's agree on that right away!**  
Not only is Philips Hue an IoT must-have, but as a developer it's especially exciting that you can get started on building your own apps and web services that controls your light system right away!  

Every Hue bridge comes with a simple web app built into it, the _API Debug Tool_, which you can use to learn how the Hue REST API works 'under the hood' and which can be useful to debug your app during development.

Yes, we all love Hue, but can we just agree that this debugger simply don't do Hue justice?  
If you think this looks tedious and unpractical to use, you're absolutely spot on.  
Indeed, this is not an end-user interface, but why should we developers suffer unnecessarily?

This is the main motivation for building an enhanced graphical user interface to interact with the Hue REST API in a much more satisfying way.
